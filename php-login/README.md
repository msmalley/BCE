# BC Embassy PHP Login Example

This example uses PHP and the block-chain as a way to authenticate login without the need for a database and for the length of that login to be based on the amount of Bitcoin directly sent.

=====

This example will not work unless hosted within an environment that also has the [BitcoinQT](http://bitcoin.org/en/download) running.

You will also need to rename config-sample.ini to just config.ini and update the Bitcoin server specific details.

From here, you can also control how much BTC it costs for 24 hours of access.

=====

# Screenshots

If not logged-in and Bitcoin server is online and config.ini is set correctly, you should see something like:
